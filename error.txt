On start of the main.py file, it does not do the following:
1. It does not provide the device IP, Port, ETC.

-- Feature Request --

1. Add a terminal based gui built into the main.py, include a screen clearing function to insure that it does not go into an "Overflow" mode (Too many lines in termial slowing the device down exponetaially). 
2. Inside of this gui i would like the following:
	1. System uptime (for server)
	2. Server IP:Port
	3. Connected Users
	4. Connections to the server
	5. Banned IP's from the current section
	6. IP's Verfied and Connection time
		along with this i would like a subsection saying where that user is currently located in the server
	7. Current Device Ussage for the server
